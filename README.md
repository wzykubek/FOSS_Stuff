# FOSS and privacy software

In this repo you can find some free, open source and privacy applications and services to stop use
proprietary spyware. If you have other advices, suggestions or apps/services which I can add it to
this document please [contribute](./CONTRIBUTING.md) or open an issue.

## [#FreeYourAndroid](https://fsfe.org/campaigns/android/android.en.html)

+ Change proprietary apps on your Android phone to FOSS alternatives.
+ You can change stock ROM to custom ROM without Google Play Services (GApps).
+ Install applications from [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/) instead of using Google Play Store.

## Desktop OS

## Other tips

* Encrypt your files and mails with [GPG](https://gnupg.org/) encryption.
* If you can, use [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/) instead of VPN services.
